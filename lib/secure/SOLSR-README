NOTE:
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLUIGN HAS CEASED FROM OLSRD 0.4.8
THIS PLUGIN WILL ONLY WORK WITH OLSRD <= 0.4.7

There has been some heavy internal rewrites that will
affect the way this plugin works in a serious way. The
outputbuffering in olsrd is completely rewritten to
work on a pr. interface basis. Due to this, this plugin 
is no longer functional with olsrd >= 0.4.8. Sorry.

If you would like to update and maintain this plugin,
drop me a mail at andreto@olsr.org

OLD README:

Secure OLSR 0.2 implementation notes
(c)Andreas Tønnesen 06.05.04

This document contains information on how to
use the secure OLSR plugin with the UniK olsr daemon.
It does _not_ cover secure OLSR protocol issues.

Lines starting with '# ' indicates shell commands.

COMPILING

  To compile simply do:
  # make

  Note that the plugin depends on the openssl libraries.

INSTALLING

  To install:
  # make install

  This will run ldconfig to update the dynamic linker.
  It might take a while.

USAGE

  To make olsrd load the secure OLSR plugin add the
  following line in the olsrd configuration file:

  LOAD_PLUGIN     olsrd_secure.so.X.X

  replacing the Xes with the version of the plugin.

  The plugin uses a shared secret key - for nodes
  to participate in the OLSR routing domain they
  need to use the key used by the other nodes.
  The key is 128-bits of size and is read from
  the file:
  /root/.olsr/olsrd_secure_key

  Copy the key to this file an all nodes. The plugin
  will terminate olsrd if this file cannot be found.

  Now start olsrd and the let the plugin do its
  thing :)
